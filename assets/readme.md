# Hull ♥ Facebook Custom Audiences

Facebook Custom Audiences allows you to create ad audiences according to their email address or phone number.

#### Facebook Custom Audience data includes:

- Identities (name, email, phone number, company, location…)
- Events (logged in, account created, subscribed…)
- Page views (Viewed “Features” page, Viewed “Demo Request” page…)
- Audiences (“Leads”, “New Paying Customers”, “Job Title - CEOs”)

#### Create Facebook Custom Audiences with data from all your other tools

With Hull, you can define these Ad Audiences as Hull Segments using data from other tools.

- Identity data from Clearbit, Salesforce and Mailchimp
- Events data from Mixpanel, Intercom and Shopify
- Pageview data from HubSpot, Shopify and Intercom
- Segment data from HubSpot, Mailchimp and Optimizely

Hull also gives you more flexibility with your data in Facebook. Combine multiple sources of data (beyond what Facebook provides) to create advanced segments (without the limits to AND and OR) and user scores using all your data.

#### More power and control over your Facebook Custom Audiences

You won’t be constrained by Facebook’s own targeting options, or by  technical limitations:

- No APIs to tap into
- No code needed
- No import/export
- No complexity
- No repetitive audience creation


## How to use:

1. Give permission to the App to manage Apps by clicking "Continue with Facebook"
2. Select the ad account to authorize
3. All your Customer segments will be replicated to the Advertising account.

If you created segments before installing this Ship, they will not be sent to Facebook initially. Hull will only synchronize Segments you update or create after this ship has been installed

If you want to switch ad accounts, just delete this ship and create another one.
